### 🌟 **What It Can Do**

* 🏖️ **Sand-Sifting Mechanism**
  Digs below the surface to catch hidden trash that traditional methods miss.

* 🦾 **Robotic Sorting Arm**
  Picks and places items into the correct bin — like a tiny beach janitor with superpowers.

* 🧠 **AI-Powered Classification**
  A machine learning model identifies and sorts items into five categories:
  
  🔹 Valuable Items
  🔹 Plastic
  🔹 Paper
  🔹 Metal
  🔹 General Waste

* 🧭 **Autonomous Navigation**
  Equipped with navigation algorithms to explore the beach safely and efficiently.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **Search & Scoop** – The robot sifts through sand to collect waste below the surface.
2. **Navigate** – It moves autonomously across the beach, avoiding obstacles on its way.
3. **Detect & Classify** – The onboard ML model identifies what type of trash was found.
4. **Sort & Store** – Each item is placed into its correct bin using the robotic hand.
